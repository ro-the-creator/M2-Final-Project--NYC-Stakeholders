### Aims

<p align='center'> 
Our focus revolved around not only cleaning and analyzing the data, but an emphasized focus on creating powerful visualizations that impact the NYC stakeholders we are presenting to.
Within the scope of the project, our stakeholders, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), have asked us to provide insights on the following questions:
</p>

1. What ZIP codes have the highest emergency department visits to hospital admissions ratio?
   - Specifically, regarding symptoms of influenza-like or pneumonia illnesses.

2. Which of these areas needs the most financial support?
   - Where should the DOHMH give more funding? Where should they give less?
