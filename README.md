# Module 2 Final Project

<p align='center'>
An analysis of emergency department visits and admissions to hospitals in NYC, using Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) data from NYC Open Data. Specifically, the emergency department visits, with regard to influenza-like or pneumonia symptoms, during the years of 2020 - 2022.

## Stakeholder

![](https://assets.codepen.io/5102/NYC_Health-logo.png)
<p align='center'>
The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, or DOHMH, is a government agency and one of the largest public health agencies in the world. They are untrusted with promoting awareness on health by providing public services, like investigating disease spread, providing health inspections, and setting up no-cost health clinics in neighborhoods where they are most needed.

If you would like to learn more about the NYC DOHMH, you can keep up with their website, where they provide extensive information on the health services they provide.

### Aims
<p align='center'> 
Our focus revolved around not only cleaning and analyzing the data, but an emphasized focus on creating powerful visualizations that impact the NYC stakeholders we are presenting to.
Within the scope of the project, our stakeholders, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), have asked us to provide insights on the following questions:
</p>

1. What ZIP codes have the highest emergency department visits to hospital admissions ratio?
   - Specifically, regarding symptoms of influenza-like or pneumonia illnesses.

2. Which of these areas needs the most financial support?
   - Where should the DOHMH give more funding? Where should they give less?
  
<p align='center'>
With these questions in mind, it was also crucial for us to present our data in an ethical way, since we were scoping out low-income neighborhoods to find where allocated funding should go. This is a sentiment we held throughout our project, considering our strong feelings towards helping New York neighborhoods.

## Analysis

<p align='center'>
As a result of our analysis, there were several key insights that were revealed in our dataset. In an overall sense, we found that Queens is the most at-risk when it comes to hospitalizations from ED symptom visits. However, there were other areas in different boroughs that had high-risk areas.
</p>

In order, the top boroughs with hospitalization risks per ED symptom visits are:
1. Queens
2. Brooklyn
3. Manhattan
4. Bronx
5. Staten Island

<p align='center'>
Upon inspecting the ZIP codes across all boroughs, we found that the top 3 ZIP codes with the highest hospital admissions from the ED symptom visits, when accounting for total visits, all resided in Queens. This was an obscure find that required deeper analysis. Manhattan, for example, had the highest rates of hospitalizations across all boroughs, but did not account for as many visits to the emergency department as the other boroughs.
</p> 

## Recommendations

<p align='center'>
As a result of our findings, we looked back at our original aims and questions:
</p>

1. Which borough had the highest rate of hospitalizations?
2. Which of these boroughs needs the most financial support?

<p align='center'>
Since we found that Queens had the highest hospitalization rates, our strongest recommendation is to provide more financial support to Queens. Upon further investigation into the ZIP codes with high hospitalization rates in Queens, we found that those areas are representative of low-income, immigrant-filled areas. These areas seem to be struggling the most and could use the help of free health clinics provided by the DOHMH.
</p>

<p align='center'>
Furthermore, our analysis reveals that, when accounting for the number of visits, Staten Island had the lowest rates of hospitalizations and was deemed a low-risk borough. With outside sources, we saw that Staten Island is particularly regarded as one of the wealthiest boroughs in NYC. With speculation, the outcome of our analysis into Staten Island could be attributed to many people being able to afford private healthcare in this borough, barring the need for additional resources from the DOHMH.

## Reflections

<p align='center'>
Given the little time we have to present, we had a long conversation about what insights were worth mentioning. In doing so, we called back to our commitment to ethical data analysis and presentation. As ethical data analysts, we found that it was most important for us to showcase the problems that Queens faces as an underrepresented borough. Anecdotally, we know that the top ZIP codes we looked at were in Corona, an area typically associated with low-income, immigrant families. Given this is a background we both come from, we found it most important to represent these findings.
</p>

<p align='center'>
Moving forward, we hope to continue showcasing underrepresented areas across the field in our data analytical work!
