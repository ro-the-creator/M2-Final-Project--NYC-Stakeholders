## Stakeholder

![](https://assets.codepen.io/5102/NYC_Health-logo.png)
<p align='center'>
The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, or DOHMH, is a government agency and one of the largest public health agencies in the world. They are untrusted with promoting awareness on health by providing public services, like investigating disease spread, providing health inspections, and setting up no-cost health clinics in neighborhoods where they are most needed.

### Aims
<p align='center'> 
Our focus revolved around not only cleaning and analyzing the data, but an emphasized focus on creating powerful visualizations that impact the NYC stakeholders we are presenting to.
Within the scope of the project, our stakeholders, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), have asked us to provide insights on the following questions:
</p>

1. What ZIP codes have the highest emergency department visits to hospital admissions ratio?
   - Specifically, regarding symptoms of influenza-like or pneumonia illnesses.

2. Which of these areas needs the most financial support?
   - Where should the DOHMH give more funding? Where should they give less?
  
<p align='center'>
With these questions in mind, it was also crucial for us to present our data in an ethical way, since we were scoping out low-income neighborhoods to find where allocated funding should go. This is a sentiment we held throughout our project, considering our strong feelings towards helping New York neighborhoods.
